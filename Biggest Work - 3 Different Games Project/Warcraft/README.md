# Warcraft
**Warcraft**


**Intro**<br>
Your task is to write a program that represents parts from the famous computer game – “Warcraft”.<br>
Three famous heroes of the game take place into the scene.<br>
Archmage – human wizard<br>
DeathKnight – undead knight<br>
DrawRanger – half elf, half undead ranger<br>
You will simulate those heroes casting basic and ultimate spells.<br>

**Provided input**<br>
You are provided with folder called Skeleton, which contains:
- A header file that contains the most important information for the task.
- A Basic Skeleton to guide you in the initial direction. You don’t need to strictly follow it.<br>
You are also provided with folder called tests, which contains all of the tests that your program should pass.
- There are a total of 13 tests. 13 inputs and 13 outputs. The 3 of the tests are copy of the ones described in this
document. The other 10 are unique.

**Task description**<br>
Your task is to provide to provide an implementation, which with the given standard input will produce the
correct standard output (detailed description below).
Each hero has the following attributes:
- name – name of the character;
- maxMaxa – the character mana pool for casting spells. (If you don’t know what ‘mana’ is – think of
it as a currency required to cast a spell).
- baseManaRegenRate – tell you how much mana points your character restores when an
ActionType::REGENERATE_MANA is performed. Keep in mind that your character can NOT
have more mana points than his “maxMaxa”. Your character can restore mana points UP to his
“maxMaxa”.

**NOTE**: The Archmage class has a special bonus attribute: “manaRegenModifier”, which scales up his mana
regeneration (multiplies baseManaRegenRate to manaRegenModifier) each time the character performs an
ActionType::REGENERATE_MANA.<br>
Each character has his unique BASIC and ULTIMATE spells that are already predefined.

`
#define MAX_SPELL_NAME_SIZE 20<br>
typedef struct {<br>
char name[MAX_SPELL_NAME_SIZE];<br>
int manaCost;<br>
} Spell;<br>
`

You are given the **main()** function, which read the data for the Archmange, DeathKnight and DrawRanger. It is
your task to implement them using this input.

Next a single integer (N) is read from the standard input.
- The next N whitespace separated integer are special ActionType commands;

`
enum ActionType {
CAST_BASIC_SPELL, CAST_ULTIMATE_SPELL, REGENERATE_MANA
};
`

“0” or ActionType::CAST_BASIC_SPELL command – all heroes should TRY to casts their BASIS spells (if
they have enough mana points);<br>
“1” or ActionType::CAST_ ULTIMATE _SPELL command – all heroes should TRY to casts their ULTIMATE
spells (if they have enough mana points);<br>
“2” or ActionType::REGENERATE_MANA command – all heroes should use their
ability to regenerate mana;<br>

**Console output**<br>
After each ActionType::CAST_BASIC_SPELL or ActionType::CAST_ULTIMATE_SPELL each hero should
print to the console a result of his actions.<br>
For successful cast you should print: ‘spell name’ casted for ‘spell mana’ followed by a newline.<br>
For unsuccessful cast you should print: ‘spell name’ – not enough mana to cast ‘spell name’ followed by a
newline.<br>
Note: ActionType::REGENERATE_MANA does NOT print any result to the console.<br>
**Special hero abilities:**
- Archmage – if SpellType::ULTIMATE is successfully casted the Archmage gets immediately a free
ActionType::REGENERATE_MANA.
- DeathKnight – if SpellType::ULTIMATE is successfully casted the DeathKnight gets immediately a
free ActionType::CAST_BASIC_SPELL.
Important note: on the free basic cast spell you should print to the console – ‘spell name’ casted for 0
mana (cast the spell for 0 mana).
- DrawRanger – if SpellType::BASIC is successfully casted the DrawRanger gets immediately a free
ActionType::CAST_BASIC_SPELL.
Important note: on the free basic cast spell you should print to the console – ‘spell name’ casted for 0
mana (cast the spell for 0 mana).

**Restrictions**<br>
Code should compile under the C 11 standard.<br>
Code should not use any non-standard extensions.
